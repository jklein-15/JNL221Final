      When the NCAA opened the transfer portal, then expanded name, image and likeness freedoms (NIL) came shortly after, college athletic departments across the United States faced a lot more than just a new world of recruiting.
      </p>

      <p>
      They were also welcomed to a new world of budgeting for their departments.
      </p>

      <p>
      Institutional reporting to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database shows that departments have re-allocated money in a number of ways. Coaches pay and recruiting expenses have gone up. As has the amount of money invested into athlete support services. But other categories, evidently deemed less critical, have bled money in recent years since the NCAA’s wide-scale changes.
      </p>

      <p>
      From a structural standpoint, the transfer portal has changed the way teams are forced to build their rosters. Recruiting, which was once a seasonal push for each sport, has become a constant triage. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Researchers and athletic department administrators have called the portal “free agency.” Its introduction means players can move faster and freer and it raises the cost to schools of replacing departed players. A September 2024 analysis of the impact of the portal from Frontiers in Sports and Active Living said the portal has “drastically impacted the migration of players.” It’s also forced athletic departments to invest more into recruiting not only prospective incoming players, but also to recruit the players a school already has to stay.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Knight-Newhouse Database, which aggregates Division-I schools’ self-reported revenues and expenses (it excludes most private D-I schools, since they’re not required to report data), gives us a window into how the pressure of the transfer portal translates to dollars. Of the nine Atlantic Coast conference schools that report recruiting spending, only one — Florida State, which historically operates on a higher athletics budget than its public ACC peers — didn’t report an increase in recruiting spending from the last pre-portal season, 2017, to 2024. Of the eight that did report an increase, four reported an increase of at least 104%, and none reported an increase less than 51%.

        Concurrently, NIL has created an alternate cash flow into college sports. The latest market estimates have put NIL activity in the billion-dollar range annually. Important to note, though, is that much (until the June 2025 House settlement on revenue sharing, all) of that money is handled by booster collectives and third-party agreements, not the schools themselves. The sheer amount of money involved, plus the recent changes thanks to aforementioned settlement, have forced athletic departments to build administrative infrastructure that helps them monitor and now facilitate deals while abiding by NCAA rules. Legal counsel, NIL employees, compliance officials, tech platforms, and increases in pay to coaches have all become necessities for major athletic departments in recent years.
      </p>

      <p>
        That operational friction has become obvious to those in college athletics. Garrett Coe, a former pitcher on the University of Connecticut baseball team who spent time as a volunteer assistant coach with the Huskies after his graduation, is now an employee of Major League Baseball Properties. He says that, in the last few years of his collegiate career when the effects of the transfer portal and NIL reached the baseball landscape, he saw a shift in the role of coaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coaches are now forced to wear more hats than the traditional roles of game managers and talent developers, Coe said. They spend more time and team resources than ever before traveling to scout and recruit, working to retain current talent, conducting NCAA compliance checks, and maintaining relationships with program donors and NIL collectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Managing a program is now more expensive and just as much administrative as it is about pushing to win games.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are some tangible line-item changes in Knight-Newhouse Database that reflect Coe’s observation. Coaches, asked to do more now than ever, have seen compensation lines skyrocket as programs attempt to retain staff and vie for effective recruiters in assistant positions. In many cases, institutional funds are being re-allocated towards operations that support the athletes, like academics, compliance, and technology. But the increased money into those categories mean, to some degree almost everywhere, money is re-distributed away from other areas, most notably student aid, but also meals, travel and equipment.

        But it doesn’t matter for the really wealthy programs. They can still easily turn booster money into a competitive advantage, thanks to the expanded NIL freedoms that stretch beyond the limitations of the athletic department. This only makes college athletics less competitively balanced. It forces smaller programs to spend beyond their means if they want to retain their talent.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, what does this mean for budgets going forward? The short answer is that those budgets will continue to spike, at least until there’s some kind of sweeping limitations or cap put on spending. Until that happens, athletic departments are going to keep redirecting and expanding their spending in three main areas: talent acquisition, staffing and compliance.
